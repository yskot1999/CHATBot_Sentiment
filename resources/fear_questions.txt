What are you up to?
How was your day?
How is your mental health?
What do you feel?
How's it going?
If a I could tell you one things about your future what would you want to know?
Is there something that you've dreamt over a long time but haven't done it?
What are you afraid of?
What is your most terrible memory and what was it?
Do you have any important deadlines to meet?
How would you describe your day?
Are you okay with not knowing what happens next?
