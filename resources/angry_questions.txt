What are you up to?
How was your day?
Are you okay?
How is your mental health?
What are you upto these days?
What do you feel?
What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?
How would you describe your day?
Are you mad at someone?
Why are you frustated right now?
Did you fight someone?
I'd like to hear more about it
You seem to look irritated.Why?
